## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application Text Editor. Users are able to write code in the online application. When away from the online application, the website will hold the user's code. The users are also provided an option to download the PWA to use the text editor in an offline mode. The user's work will persist over to the online version when reloaded. 

## Installation

When users click the download button, the application will automatically download into your downloads folder. 

## Usage

If you are using this app from github you will need to be sure to 'npm i' before using 'npm run start'. If you are using this app from Heroku, everything should be set for you.
